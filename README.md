# MidJourney-PHOTO-prompt-Generator
Simple PHOTO prompt generator in help of MidJourney newbies/users
It will work as is for chrome as well, however as far as all Alphabet products are over-commercialized I don`t participate in any of them
Feel free if You want to add it to their project as well

The extension could be used to help new user to create very good images and same time to understand the basics of the prompts creation and to learn how to do themself more precise prompts.

As the nature of other types of image generations as ex. Art are more complex I don`t think we could create something similar and useful enough, but I`m open for suggestions.
